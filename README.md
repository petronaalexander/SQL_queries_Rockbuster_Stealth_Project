# SQL_queries_Rockbuster_Stealth_Project

Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC i s a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team i s planning to use i ts existing movie l icenses to
launch an online video rental service i n order to stay competitive.
You’ve been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business i ntelligence (BI)
department to help with the l aunch strategy for the new online video service. The BI
department helps other departments, from i nventory to customer i nsights, with data-related
queries. Your first task i s to l oad all of Rockbuster’s data i nto a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.
Before you can begin your analysis and answer more complex business questions, you’ll
need to acquire a good understanding of the various data points. You’ll eventually compile
the results of your analysis i nto an easily digestible format, which will be presented to the
Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.
Key Questions and Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions they’d l ike to answer:
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based i n?
● Where are customers with a high l ifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

Context
To answer the questions posed by the different departments, you’ll query the data using SQL
(short for structured query l anguage). Throughout this Achievement, you’ll l earn SQL
incrementally, and you’ll use i t to answer i ncreasingly complex business questions for each
task. The results of your analysis will be presented to Rockbuster management, so you’ll
need to visualize the data i n an easy-to-consume manner. In other words, you’ll build on what
you’ve l earned i n previous Achievements.
Although you’ll be working with data from the online video streaming i ndustry for this
project, the skills you develop could be applied to any i ndustry and will highlight your ability
to solve problems for a variety of clients. The aim i s to give you hands-on experience with
SQL. By the time you finish your project, you’ll be able to use SQL to perform various kinds of
query-based analyses.
Data Set
In this Achievement, you’ll be using a data set that contains i nformation about Rockbuster’s
film i nventory, customers, and payments, among other things. The first thing you’ll need to
do i s l oad the data set i nto the PostgreSQL database. Keep i n mind the following points
regarding the data set:
● It’s around 3MB and contains several files.
● A relationship exists between two tables i f a column name i s present i n both tables.
To i nstall PostgreSQL and l oad the Rockbuster data set i nto i t, follow the i nstructions i n
Exercise 3.1: Introduction to Relational Databases carefully.
● Download the Rockbuster data set
● Download PostgreSQL Database (for Windows, macOS X, and Linux)

Project Deliverables
At the end of each Exercise, you’ll complete a task and submit a deliverable that directly
contributes to your final project—in this case, an analysis that answers business questions
put forward by the management team.
Your tutor will review and give you feedback on your deliverables for tasks 3.1 to 3.9. Your
final project, which you’ll submit at the end of Exercise 10, will be reviewed by your mentor,
who will also give you feedback on how your project relates to the work of a data analyst.
Final Analysis Criteria
Your final project will be evaluated on your ability to:
● Write moderately complex SQL queries to answer business questions.
● Present your SQL results to business managers by creating visualizations and telling
a compelling story.
● Present your SQL results to your technical colleagues using Excel and by creating a
data dictionary.
● Create a professional project that you can add to your portfolio and show to
employers.

Here is a SQL query with a common table expression:

WITH total_amount_paid_cte (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city)
AS

(SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name,
       D.country,
	   C.city,
	   SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei','So Leopoldo','Tianjin','Hami','Cianjur')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5) 

SELECT AVG (total_amount_paid) AS Average
FROM total_amount_paid_cte
